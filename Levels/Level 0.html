Level 0 is a white, empty, flat space. It contains only one portal to Level 1, and a non-functional portal to every other level at regular intervals. To make portals to other levels work, you need to find a special key, hidden somewhere in The Infinite. The key is not necessarily hidden in the level it unlocks.
